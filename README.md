# sers.pt.transformer


This study collected clinical urine samples, used SERS technology to enhance and obtain high-quality Raman spectral signals, used the Transformer model to learn the model, and finally achieved accurate classification.


## File Explanation

- `raman_transformer_model.pth`: The trained Transformer model parameter file.
- `results.csv`: Samples for training and testing.
- `sers.qt.transformer.py`: Code for training and testing the Transformer model.
